# hello-world
my first git lecture and test run of my data science class on John Hopkins University
Hi human!

Hubot here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!),
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tavos.
so after yesteday's practice, i was having some difficulties
so i decided to try the branching process and how to commit on github
this is just to rerun what i previously did but this time on my own
hopefully i am getting a hang of this github thingy
and i am super happy i am getting it right
God's willing i will be develpoing one of the greatest machine learning tool 
and also the one of the best AI model to help the human race
